## Usage

### Simple Payment Processing
```php
use Jorjika\BogPayment\Facades\Pay;
// ...
$paymentDetails = Pay::orderId($transaction->id)
            ->redirectUrl(route('bog.v1.transaction.status', ['transaction_id' => $transaction->id]))
            ->amount($data['total_amount'])
            ->process();
```
`process()` will return an array of payment details as an associative array.

here's an example of the response:
```php
$paymentDetails = [
    'id' => 'test-id',
    'redirect_url' => 'https://example.com/redirect',
    'details_url' => 'https://example.com/details',
]
```
**Recommended**: At this stage, create a transaction record and store the returned payment details in your database.

Once youâ€™ve saved the payment information, redirect the user to the `redirect_url` provided in the response. This URL will direct the user to the payment gateway where they can complete the transaction. After successful payment processing, the user will be redirected back to the redirect_url specified in your request.

### Save Card During Payment

To save the card during the payment process, you can use the `saveCard()` method. This method will save the card details for future transactions.

When you want to save card during the payment, you need to do the following:

```php
use Jorjika\BogPayment\Facades\Pay;

// SaveCard method will initiate another request that notifies bank to save card details
$response = Pay::orderId($external_order_id)->amount($amount)->saveCard()->process();

// Example response
$response = [
    'id' => 'test-id',
    'redirect_url' => 'https://example.com/redirect',
    'details_url' => 'https://example.com/details',
];
```
When you receive the response, you can save the card details in your database, where `id` is the saved card(parent transaction) id that you would use for later transactions.

### Payment with Saved Card
Once you have saved new payment method id in your database, you can initiate payments on saved cards like so:

```php
$response = Pay::orderId($external_order_id)->amount($amount)->chargeCard("test-id");

// Example response
$response = [
    'id' => 'test-id',
    'redirect_url' => 'https://example.com/redirect',
    'details_url' => 'https://example.com/details',
];
```
Functionality above will charge saved card without the user interaction.


## Building the payload

Although the package provides a convenient way to initiate payments, you can also build the payment payload manually using the provided traits.

The BuildsPayment trait helps you build the payload for payments quickly by providing the following methods

Here's how you do it:

```php

getPayload(): // Retrieves the current payload array.

orderId($externalOrderId): // Sets the external order ID for the payment.

callbackUrl($callbackUrl): // Sets a custom callback URL for the payment process.

redirectUrl($statusUrl): // Sets both success and fail URLs to the same value for redirection after the payment.

redirectUrls($failUrl, $successUrl): // Sets separate fail and success URLs for redirection after the payment.

amount($totalAmount, $currency = 'GEL', $basket = []): // Defines the total amount, currency, and optionally, the basket details for the payment.

// These methods allow for easy customization of the payment payload to suit various payment requirements.
```

## Callback Handling

The package handles callback behavior automatically. When a payment is processed, it will send a POST request to your callback URL with the payment details. The package then verifies the request's signature to ensure its authenticity and fires the Nikajorjika\BogPayment\Events\TransactionStatusUpdated event, which contains all relevant payment details.

To utilize this functionality, register an event listener in your application to capture and respond to the transaction status updates as needed.

Example: Registering a Listener for Transaction Status Updates
Add the following code to your event listener:

```php
namespace App\Listeners;

use Nikajorjika\BogPayment\Events\TransactionStatusUpdated;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue;
use Illuminate\Queue\InteractsWithQueue;

class HandleTransactionStatusUpdate implements ShouldQueue
{
use InteractsWithQueue;

    /**
     * Handle the event.
     *
     * @param  \Nikajorjika\BogPayment\Events\TransactionStatusUpdated  $event
     * @return void
     */
    public function handle(array $event)
    {
        // Implement your logic here
    }
```
### Setting Up the Event Listener

Register the event listener in your EventServiceProvider to ensure it's triggered when the TransactionStatusUpdated event is fired:

```php
protected $listen = [
    \Nikajorjika\BogPayment\Events\TransactionStatusUpdated::class => [
        \App\Listeners\HandleTransactionStatusUpdate::class,
    ],
];
```
This setup allows your application to handle transaction status updates efficiently, enabling you to respond to each status change in real time.


## Handling Transaction Status

The package provides a convenient way to retrieve the status of a transaction using the `Transaction` Facade's `get()` method. This method sends a GET request to the Bank of Georgia payment API to retrieve the transaction status.

Here's how you can use it:

```php
use Jorjika\BogPayment\Facades\Transaction;

$transactionDetails = Transaction::get($order_id); // Returns array of transaction details
```

See example of the response [Official Documentation](https://api.bog.ge/docs/payments/standard-process/get-payment-details)
